# Short about “Low”

I’ve just realised that when Flo Rida sings…

> Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur.<br/>
> The whole club was lookin’ at her.<br/>
> She hit the flo’, next thing you know,<br/>
> Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low.

… it’s a pun on “shorty”.
She’s low down.

Presumably because of how she’s dancing.

Although I suppose she’d also be low down if she were literally hitting the floor (with her fists).
