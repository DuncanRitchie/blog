# Eurovision 2025 — Round-up of bad lyrics

I might be something of an oddity, in that I enjoy Eurovision, I want a particular country to stop using Eurovision to distract from its many misdeeds in Palestine, but I’m continuing to write blogposts about Eurovision each year.
Eh, it’s my blog, I’ll write about what I like… or about what I don’t like.
Dodgy lyrics are not quite as bad as potential war-crimes, or indeed this opening paragraph, but anyway, on with the article.

Delightfully, a lot of countries are showing off their own languages at the song contest this year.
Latvia, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, San Marino, Poland, Sweden, and Iceland all sang in English last year, but not in 2025.
The six countries that automatically qualify are all singing in their national languages (for the first time since 1999).
Even Sweden is performing in a dialect of Finland Swedish, and it’s not English-language radio-friendly synth-pop like they (nearly) always send.

It might even be the Eurovision with the most non-English songs ever.

However, Eurovision 2025 still has some songs in my language… and some of those lyrics are not very good.

<h3 id="ireland">🇮🇪</h3>

Ireland’s song is about Laika, the first dog in space, and how much fun she could be having in the cosmos (in the singer’s imagination).

> You have probably heard ’bout this brave little girl.<br/>
> All we know is that she saved the world.<br/>
> She got sent away, but she wasn't afraid.

I’d love to hear the rationale for claiming the world could be saved by sending a dog into orbit.
Furthermore, said dog was trapped in a capsule too small for her to turn around in, her heart-rate was recorded to more than double during take-off, and she died of overheating after a few hours.
“But she wasn’t afraid!”

> Through thе comets and the stones,<br/>
> she is howling for her bones.

I think this means, “While she is up in space, Laika is barking in anticipation of receiving the bones of other animals as treats.”
That would fit with the concept of the song as fantasizing an optimistic life for Laika living out her years in doggy heaven (in contrast to reality).
But the lyric sounds so weird to me.

A dog howling isn’t usually a sign of pleasure.
The phrase “her bones” makes me think of the dog’s own skeleton, and therefore her mortality.
So is she howling in anguish, foreseeing no dignified burial for her corpse?

Also, meteors and suchlike are not “stones”.
I mean, they are, maybe, but it doesn’t sound very celestial or poetic.

> Playing fetch up in the void<br/>
> with her ball an asteroid,<br/>
> over the moon and she’s overjoyed.<br/>
> Free of earthly human cares,<br/>
> party clothes she wears:<br/>
> a fur coat and Moon boots and solar flares.

Okay, I wrote that one.
It’s not the real lyrics.

Moving on…

<h3 id="armenia">🇦🇲</h3>

> I’m a survivor, stay-aliver.

That’s not a word.

<h3 id="cyprus">🇨🇾</h3>

> I’ve got golden locks…

Says a brunet.

<h3 id="denmark">🇩🇰</h3>

> My vision is blurry but I can see clearly.

Which one is it?

<h3 id="sweden">🇸🇪</h3>

> Take a breath and breathe.

This has the opposite problem to the Denmark lyric, in that it’s tautology instead of contradiction.
Fortunately, it’s not a Eurovision lyric per se.

It was the first line of the first song in the final of Sweden’s Melodifestivalen 2025 — John Lundvik’s “Voice of the Silent” — and would have represented Sweden at Eurovision if it had won Melodifestivalen.
After such a not-great start, the national contest did actually improve, culminating with the last song, <q lang="sv-FI">Bara bada bastu</q>, which I would be quite happy to win Eurovision.

<h3 id="ukraine">🇺🇦</h3>

> Fly, bird, I'm begging you, begging you.<br/>
> Please just live, share my heart with someone who cares<br/>
> of me and my little bird of pray.

This isn’t really a bad lyric, but it is rather abstruse.
I initially wondered whether something was getting lost in translation, though it’s in English (at least for this chorus).

As I understand it, the bird is a metaphor for freedom, and freedom (especially in Ukraine) is a precarious thing subject to the whims of fate (or the Putins and Trumps of the world), which is why it’s a bird of “pray” with that spelling.
So Ziferblat are praying for the freedom to communicate with people who care about them and their shared freedoms.

The second verse talks about coming home and migratory birds ushering spring, which is more clearly about wanting Ukrainian refugees to be able to return to their country and re-build it after the war.
That makes sense.

It would also be pretty cool if the Palestinians that have been displaced in the past several years could likewise get the chance to return and re-build.
It really is appalling what Isr— sorry, I’m getting distracted.
Like migrating birds, I should return to (writing about) Ukraine.

So yeah, Ziferblat are using birds as a metaphor for freedom and the Ukrainians seeking it.

Or maybe the song is about a falconry exhibit I chanced upon when I was twelve.
