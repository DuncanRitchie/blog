# Good things happening to me in 2025

This has been a really good year for me, despite my continued unemployment.
I started [volunteering for an autism group](#social-events) in my city, I completed my years-long effort to [re-architect my Latin dictionary](#velut), I achieved a [certification in modern manufacturing](#3d-printing-course), and I made a lot of [upgrades to this blog](#this-blog).
Read on for more details!

## Personal coding

### This blog

My blog now has its own [search](./search) feature!
It uses a JavaScript library called [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) and I found a [tutorial from Alex Trost](https://trost.codes/posts/adding-simple-search-to-an-astro-blog/) to show me how to integrate it.
Then I added my own CSS and made a mini search-bar on the blog’s homepage that takes you to the full page of results.
Here’s [my full write-up of it](./adding-search).

<SearchFormBasic />

What’s more, this blog now supports Markdown Extended, which is how I got the search-bar to appear in this post.

I’ve also added [view transitions](./adding-view-transitions), a [page listing the blog’s RSS feeds](./rss), and a [“Short”](./tags/short) tag that automatically applies to my shortest articles.
My blog now does [CSS Naked Day](./css-naked-day).
And I made my first charts with the graphing library Plotly, for an [article of graphs relating to velut](./graphs-of-lemma-and-word-counts).

In November, I installed Open Graph images into the blog — this means that when you link to an article from social media, a screenshot of the article appears with the link.
Then I posted links to several of my articles about software to [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-ritchie-uk/recent-activity/all/).
Three senior developers that I’ve worked with were kind enough to write recommendations of me for my Linkedin profile — thanks guys!

In 2026, I might improve how the Open Graph thing works, since it’s not the most automated solution and there’s a risk I’ll post an article without generating the image for it.
But it was cool to see the screenshots show up on Linkedin.

### velut

I’ve finished moving [velut](https://www.velut.co.uk) (my Latin dictionary) to a new architecture!
This enables (or indeed, requires) me to generate inflected forms programmatically.
For 31 months, the list of dictionary headwords (lemmata) in velut did not change, but the inflected forms have gradually changed from the ones I had added manually to the new generated ones.

In fact, there have been more than two million inflected forms getting generated, and I’ve been reviewing them manually before publishing them to the live website.
This took about 22 months, concluding in May this year.

All the data for velut are coming from a Json file of lemmata and some JavaScript scripts.
The dictionary has gone from being on Excel file in its entirety, to not using Excel at all.

For full details, see my article on the [“de-Excellation” of velut](./deexcellation-of-velut).
Alongside that, I have a post with [graphs relating to the dictionary](./graphs-of-lemma-and-word-counts).

#### Hosting

I’ve also been playing around with how the velut website is hosted.
It’s now running on Digital Ocean, behind Cloudflare for bot-detection and caching.
(Tip: when caching a Next.js app in Cloudflare, exclude “_next” routes.)

Previously, velut was running on Fly.io, first without Cloudflare, then with it.
Fly.io offered a good service, but Digital Ocean’s servers are supposedly carbon-neutral (as are Cloudflare’s).
I already had an instance running on Digital Ocean, so I was confident that the switch wouldn’t hurt the website’s uptime.

## Social events

I joined a [social group of autistic adults](./autistic-social-groups) in Chester (named Aspire), and became a founding member of their governing committee — I’m the tech officer.
This has helped their activities run more smoothly and takes strain off the group’s leader, who can now delegate tasks to myself and others.

### Days out

This year, I had several days out with friends, including a walk around Crosby Marine Lake and three visits to Chester Zoo.
(Plus another trip to the zoo, by myself.)
I really did not anticipate going to the zoo four times in five months, but I amazingly had the opportunity with the help of Aspire.
Out of 74 exhibits on the official map, I’ve seen nearly all of them this year!

Unfortunately I missed out on seeing cheetahs, since the two elderly cheetahs at the zoo both died in June, but apart from that, I have done really well at exploring the place!

</figure>
</div>

I did a [course in modern manufacturing](./3d-printing) and now have my own 3D printer.
(The Government is cool sometimes, since they paid for it!)

I’ve printed a few things on it, often my own designs.

I have a reading-lamp whose base is not flat but convex (so the lamp would fall over easily) and whose power-button is unindented on another side of the lamp (so it was hard to find in the dark) — but these problems were solved when I made a case that wraps around the lamp’s body, featuring a chamfered hole that guides my finger toward the power-button.

And when a friend lamented that she’d lost a domino out of a set, I supplied a replica for the missing piece.

I also designed and printed a trophy for the monthly quiz that I help put on for Aspire, and five ornaments that I used as team mascots at the [Christmas episode](./autistic-social-groups#:~:text=we%20held%20a-,Christmas%20quiz,-%2C%20again%20written%20and) of that quiz.

## Conclusion

So I’ve developed technical skills on the 3D-printing course.
I’m improving my soft skills (verbal communication, self-confidence, etc) as the tech officer and quiz compère at Aspire.
And (what I haven’t mentioned) I’m getting help with my job-hunting and interview technique with a work coach that I meet frequently.

In January I was looking forward to completing the velut migration.
I’ve ended up achieving that, and so much more!
Paid employment is still eluding me, but hopefully I’m on track for that to change in the new year!
