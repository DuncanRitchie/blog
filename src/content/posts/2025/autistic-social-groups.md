# Autistic social groups

Have I mentioned my autism on this blog?
I haven’t, though perhaps it’s no surprise given the depth of my interests in software/Latin/whatever and my continued difficulty in getting a job.

But anyway, I’ve been a member of an autistic Wirral/Liverpool social group since the easing of the Covid-19 pandemic.
This has been good — we’ve had some very pleasant meet-ups in cafés, museums, parks, etc — but I wanted to find other neurodivergent people closer to where I am in Chester.
A friend in Runcorn established an autistic group over there, a twenty-minute train ride from me, and I wondered what was available in my home city.

I had spent January being fairly self-absorbed, making a huge amount of [progress with my Latin dictionary](./deexcellation-of-velut) but not doing as much for a social life.

Fortunately, through my connections in the Runcorn group, I discovered Aspire, a social group for autistic adults in Chester.
It had been going for eight years without my noticing.
I duly joined, in February, and since then I’ve been reliably attending their sessions every week.

We meet regularly in the city centre, and go on trips every month.
The day with the most spectacular natural surroundings was when we walked out to Hilbre Island in the Dee estuary.
I had never been there before and we picked a wonderfully sunny day to go.

Chester Zoo gave us several free tickets, enabling a group outing (or three), much to our enjoyment.
The zoo opened its new “Heart of Africa” section this year, where antelope and giraffes and other savannah animals mingle, though I also liked the older enclosures (eg the Tropical Realm with its free-flying birds and several reptiles/amphibians).

More generally, it’s been lovely to have a small group of people to talk to and play boardgames with, where social dynamics can be a little more straightforward than what you might get from neurotypicals.

Besides, Aspire has been going through its own changes.
It was growing large enough that we wanted a committee to run it.
So I became one of six founding members of the Aspire Committee!

As their tech officer, I help to deal with their email inbox and moderate their Facebook community, and I design a monthly newsletter.
New members complete a registration form that I also designed.
And of course, I contribute my thoughts whenever we have committee meetings.
I even chaired one meeting, since I was appointed deputy chair.

Aspire puts a monthly quiz on for our members, and I have particularly enjoyed writing questions and being the compère for those sessions.
One of my quiz rounds was on the animals we saw at Chester Zoo, using photos I had taken.
Impressively, someone identified a zebra as being of the Grévy’s species.

In December we held a Christmas quiz, again written and compèred by me.
I may have gone a bit overboard in the preparation — I turned up with five picture-rounds among 125 questions, in two ringbinders, as well as five team mascots that I had produced with my newly-acquired [3D printer and CAD skills](./3d-printing)!
Still, it was very entertaining, we certainly didn’t run out of quiz material, and everyone had a good time.
One member of the group doesn’t like competing in quizzes much, so he read out the questions and answers with me (hence the second ringbinder) and we could all enjoy the session more because of that.

What are we doing in the new year?
We’ll be continuing a lot of what we’ve been doing, and we intend to produce leaflets about the group, so fewer potential members will not realise we exist.
I’ve already designed posters for the Runcorn autism group, so I can definitely help Aspire with that!
