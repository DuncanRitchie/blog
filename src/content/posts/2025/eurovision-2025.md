# Eurovision 2025 — My rankings

In continuation of my annual tradition, here is my personal ranking of the 37 songs in the Eurovision Song Contest 2025.
For each song, I’ve heard the studio version, read the translated lyrics (when not in English), and watched the stage performance.

The emoji relate to the semi-final that each act participated in (1️⃣or 2️⃣) and whether the act passed their semi-final (✅ or ❌, with 🟩 for the Big Five and host country that go through to the grand final automatically).

🇲🇩 Moldova is not competing this year (it’s their first no-show since they débuted in the contest), but we’re getting 🇲🇪 Montenegro back.

Despite a ceasefire declared earlier this year, Israel is continuing to destroy Gaza and the West Bank with brutal war and illegal occupation.
It is blockading aid from entering Gaza, and the UN says two million people in the strip are on the brink of famine.
Civilians and humanitarian workers have been deliberately targeted.

Israel has some legitimate motivation of defending itself against the terrorist group Hamas, but that should not give the country the right to attack innocent people so horrifically (as it does) or to annexe all of Palestine (as it plans to).
The International Criminal Court is continuing to investigate Israel and Hamas for their alleged war crimes.
