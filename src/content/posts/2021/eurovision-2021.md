# Eurovision 2021 — My rankings

I ranked the contestants in Eurovision 2021 based on the music videos and national final performances, before the semi-finals.

In the list below I have also included the semi-final the songs competed in (1️ or 2️) — with 🟩 for the countries that go straight through to the grand final (Big Five and the host Netherlands). I’ve also included whether the song got into the grand final (✅ or ❌).

The contest was cancelled last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, although the countries had already chosen their acts and songs. Twenty-six of the artists that would have competed in 2020 were invited back this year, albeit with new songs. These are marked with 🔁. The other 13 artists are marked with 🆕 because they were new artists with new songs, rather than re-invited artists with new songs.

There were two songs this year with the same name, “Amen”. Neither got into the final. Additionally, there was a song this year with the same name as a song from last year (“You”). It also didn’t get into the final.

The actual winner was Italy, who were far from my favourite this year, but I appreciated Måneskin’s energy and brashness.
As it happens, my favourite song last year <em>was</em> for Italy — Diodato’s <span lang="it">“Fai Rumore”</span>, a song that I think is very thoughtful.
The title translates as “You Make Noise”, and Måneskin’s song-title means “Quiet and Good”, so they could be describing one another!
Anyway, Italy didn’t get the chance to win with Diodato, but they won with Måneskin instead.
Which I quietly think is <span lang="it">bueno</span>.
