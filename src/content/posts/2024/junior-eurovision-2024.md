# Junior Eurovision 2024 — My rankings

I ranked the seventeen contestants in Junior Eurovision 2024 during the live show today, before the public vote opened.
(Or re-opened; they allowed early voting before the show.)

As ever with the contest, this is my opinion of the songs and staging, not the kids themselves; they all did great.

The United Kingdom did not compete this year.
Instead we got Cyprus and San Marino, which hadn’t participated since 2017 and 2015 respectively.

## Footnotes

1. 🇪🇸 Last year’s flag parade used the Jain song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59Q_lhgGANc">“Makeba”</a>, which was a tribute to Miriam Makeba. This year the host country wrote an entire song about a titaness of music, Lola Flores. And the contest’s slogan this year is “Let’s Bloom”, which fits with Flores’ surname! She’s really getting her flowers.
1. 🇮🇹 Trampoline bed!
1. 🇬🇪 The lyrics are quite poetic, comparing maternal love to the sun, sky, and snow. The snow is described as pink. Let’s assume it makes more sense in Georgian.
1. 🇨🇾 Weirdly enough for a song about waters, the dance-break and some of the graphics were more <a lang="es" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyDTbJ4wenY">“Fuego”</a> (Cyprus’s song from adult Eurovision 2018).
1. 🇵🇱 I imagine the “Let’s Bloom” slogan is why Poland’s lyric is, “I’m not afraid to bloom like a flower.” But Albania out-flower-powered them with a song about dancing with a flower. Take that, Poland. You’ll have to make do with second place in terms of flower allusions (or third if we count Chloe DelaRosa having a rose in her name and singing about Flores). 🌹
