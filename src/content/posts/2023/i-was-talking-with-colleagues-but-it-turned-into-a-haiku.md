# I was talking with colleagues about a former colleague but it turned into a haiku and then a set of tankas

Had a chat with Guy…<br/>
He’s got a new job… says hi.<br/>
Why’d he leave us, why?!<br/>
He’s moved on to some place nice…<br/>
What’s a better place than us???

Hey, this is in rhyme!<br/>
What a fun coincidence.<br/>
Yeah, I guess it’s fine.<br/>

“Writing verse brings glee.”<br/>
Guy has moved on, so must we.<br/>
Reading verse? Ennui!<br/>
What’s a sadder sight to see:<br/>
Guy gone, or this poetry?

It’s fun to write verse.<br/>
Reading it is the reverse!<br/>
More rhymes make it worse.<br/>
Better keep them pithy, terse:<br/>
“Nothing down here, please disperse.”

Short, yet full of woe,<br/>
haikus have us feeling low.<br/>
This is one. Oh no!<br/>
Two more lines of verse? No thanks!<br/>
It’s a tanka ’cause it tanks.

_Note: My ex-colleague’s name isn’t actually Guy; I just picked that for the rhyme. However, my company’s acronym is ICE, which does rhyme with “nice”, but somehow I find “us” funnier to end the first stanza._
