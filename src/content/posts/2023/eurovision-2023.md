# Eurovision 2023 — My rankings

I ranked the thirty-seven contestants in Eurovision 2023 based on the music videos and national final performances (whichever were posted to the song contest’s YouTube channel), before the semi-finals.

In the list below I have also included the semi-final the songs will participate in (1️⃣ or 2️⃣ with 🟩 for the countries that go straight through to the grand final).
After the semi-finals happened (May 9th & 11th), I added a tick or cross for whether the song got into the grand final (✅ or ❌).

## Comments from after the final

Seeing a song on stage makes me like it more.
Poland, Belgium, Israel, and Finland are all acts I would have ranked higher if I hadn’t just been basing my opinions off the music video.
Perhaps next year I’ll formulate my rankings during the intervals in the semi-finals so I’ll have seen all performances on live TV.

Belgium this year reminded me of Israel last year — both queer disco bangers about being proud in yourself.
Israel this year reminded me of Austria last year — both energetic pop-songs that felt a bit too “busy” for my liking.
Austria this year reminded me of Serbia last year — both female-led, very catchy, and on serious (and weird) subject-matters.
Serbia this year reminded me of Serbia last year — Konstrakta is a mentor of Luke Black and both do creepy performance-art.

All ten songs I wanted in the final from the first semi-final got through to the final.
In the second semi-final, which had worse songs in my opinion than the first semi-final, there was no correlation between my opinion and what songs got through.
This was also all true last year!
