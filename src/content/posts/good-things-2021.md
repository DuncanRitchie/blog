I’m continuing to work for a small IT company in Cheshire called [Information Catalyst](https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/code#employment), also known as ICE.

I passed my Level 4 Software Developer apprenticeship. As coursework for that, I submitted a 20,000-word treatise about my work on a program that analyses Microsoft Word documents. I don’t think it needed to be as long as that, but I like to be comprehensive and the software I’m making is really interesting.

Also at work I joined the ICE Orchestration project, which has taught me a lot about several technologies that I was unfamiliar with (Java, Eclipse, Gradle, Liferay, Grafana, MySql, etc). I’m the main developer working on allowing users to access external lists of online services from our Orchestration platform.

## Personal coding
On my [Latin vocabulary website](https://www.velut.co.uk), users can now input [multiple words at once](https://www.velut.co.uk/many) and find out which ones are in my dictionary. I have made a lot of progress in porting the site to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, which will improve performance and reduce the reliance on client-side JavaScript. I have further reduced my reliance on Excel.

On my [personal website](https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk), users can toggle between two layout options.

## Holiday
My parents, my dog, and I had a holiday in Northumberland. We went on several walks; visited a few castles, churches, museums, and ruins; ate a lot of food; and saw some birds (including curlew, wigeon, golden plover, and pink-footed goose). Places included Bamburgh, Lindisfarne, Craster, Cragside Estate, and Vercovicium.
