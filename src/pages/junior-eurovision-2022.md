# Junior Eurovision 2022 â€” My rankings

Iâ€™ve been following the adult Eurovision Song Contest since I was small, because the UK has consistently participated and itâ€™s always been on BBC TV.

However, the UK has never entered the junior version of the contest, and so Iâ€™ve never paid much attention to it, until recently. My country is making its Junior Eurovision dÃ©but in 2022, and I started this blog this year too, so I figured I should write this article, like Iâ€™ve done for [previous contests](tag/eurovision/).

I ranked the sixteen songs in Junior Eurovision 2022, having seen the music videos but not any live performances. This is a reflection of my taste in music, rather than judgement on the performers; the kids are all great.

   <br>The song on this list that lives up to its title the least.

   <br>Thereâ€™s a moment of silence between the bridge and the chorus, and it makes the song sound disjointed.
   <br>Love the environmentalist message, but the songâ€™s a bit dull.
